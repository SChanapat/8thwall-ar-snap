### Flat Image Target Components & Primitives

```<xrextras-named-image-target>``` tracks an image target. Add content inside to copy the 
transforms from the tracked target to its children.

- name: the name of the image target as it appears on the "Image Targets" page

```xrextras-play-video``` displays a thumbnail image and waits for user tap to begin 
playback (for videos with sound).

- video: the id of the <video> element used for playback
- thumb: the id of the <img> element to serve as a thumbnail (optional)
- canstop: whether the video can be paused on tap
 
```xrextras-gesture-detector``` listens for touch gestures when added to the <a-scene> tag. 
Required for gesture components:

- xrextras-one-finger-rotate
- xrextras-two-finger-rotate
- xrextras-pinch-scale
- xrextras-hold-drag

```xrextras-one-finger-rotate``` lets the user drag along x axis to spin object around y axis.

- factor: increase this number to spin more given the same drag distance (default: 6)
